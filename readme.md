# Project Setup Guide

This guide covers the setup process for the Next.js application located in the `client` directory and the Express.js application located in the `server` directory.

## Setting Up the Next.js Client Application

1. **Navigate to the Client Directory:**

```sh

```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```sh
npm install
```

3. **Set Env Variables**

Create a .env file and paste the secrets

4. **Run the Server:**

This command starts the Next.js development server on http://localhost:3000. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Setting Up the Express.js Server Application

1. **Navigate to the Server Directory:**

```sh
cd server
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
